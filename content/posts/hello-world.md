I had a sudden burst of energy today to put something up on the internet so I created this blog. With how good today's coding agents are, it only took like an hour. It's still hard to say how that will affect my future career, but for the time being it's pretty good at getting new things up and running.

I'll try not to turn this site into abandonware, but realistically I'll have the most time and content to write about starting in the summer. Regardless, I'd like to improve my writing. Hopefully that sort of motivation will keep the ball rolling.
